The proposed system leverages the XGBoost algorithm, a powerful gradient-boosting technique,
to analyze and predict customer churn in real-time. This machine learning-based approach
provides a higher level of predictive accuracy and flexibility by utilizing a wide range of
customer data, including demographic information, transaction history, account activity, and
interactions. The system preprocesses this data through feature engineering techniques,
including age categorization and normalization, improving model performance. The predictive
model, once trained, can identify at-risk customers, providing banks with valuable insights to
enhance customer retention efforts.
